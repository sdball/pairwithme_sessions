# #pairwithme sessions with @sdball

I love remote pairing! This repo is to house code generated from remote
pairing sessions I host where the codebase doesn't already have its own repo.

Nothing important or world changing is in here, just fun times with cool
people.

## Want to pair?

I would love to do some remote pairing with you! Just email me at
sdball@gmail.com or send me a tweet: @stephenballnc.
